## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the ARCHITECTURE.md if you're making architectural changes
3. The PR should work for both development and production environments
4. Include relevant tests for your changes

## Coding Standards

1. Follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
2. Write unit tests for all new code
3. Keep the modular structure intact
4. Document all public APIs
5. Use constructor injection for dependencies

### Frontend (TypeScript/Next.js)

1. Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

5. Use Tailwind CSS for styling
